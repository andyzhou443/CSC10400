CCNY Data Structure Course Expectations: 

To become a Data Structures Expert 
start by learning…
Pre-condition/Post-condition specifications 
Time analysis techniques 
Container classes 
Pointers and dynamic arrays

Templates and iterators 
Stacks & Queues 
Recursive thinking 
Trees 
Sorting and searching techniques 
Graphs
You will be able to

(1) implement these structures as classes in C++;
(2) determine which structures are appropriate in various situations;
(3) confidently learn new structures beyond what are presented in this class.

You will also learn part of object-oriented programming and software development methodology.
