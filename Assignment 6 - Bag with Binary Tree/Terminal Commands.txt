START OF TEST 1:
Testing insert and the constant member functions (40 points).
A. Testing size and count for an empty bag.
Test passed.

B. Adding the number 4 to the bag, and then testing
   size and count.
Test passed.

C. Inserting the number 2 into the bag.
   Then checking size and count.
Test passed.

D. Inserting the number 1 into the bag.
   Then checking size and count.
Test passed.

E. Inserting the number 3 into the bag.
   Then checking size and count.
Test failed.

Test 1 failed.
END OF TEST 1.


START OF TEST 2:
Testing the copy constructor (10 points).
A. Testing that copy constructor works okay for empty bag...Test passed.

B. Testing copy constructor with 4-item bag...Test passed.

Copy constructor seems okay.
Test 2 got 10 points out of a possible 10.
END OF TEST 2.


START OF TEST 3:
Testing the assignment operator (10 points).
A. Testing that assignment operator works okay for empty bag...Test passed.

B. Testing assignment operator with 4-item bag...Test passed.

C. Testing assignment operator for a self-assignment...passed.
Assignment operator seems okay.
Test 3 got 10 points out of a possible 10.
END OF TEST 3.


START OF TEST 4:
Testing erase and erase_one functions (20 points).
Testing removal from empty bag (should have no effect) ...Test passed.

Inserting these: 8 6 10 1 7 10 15 3 13 2 5 11 14 4 12
Test failed.

Test 4 failed.
END OF TEST 4.

If you submit this BAG to the TA now, you will have
20 points out of the 100 points from this test program.
